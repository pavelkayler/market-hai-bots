# Bybit OI/Price Bot — monorepo (local)

Backend must run on http://localhost:8080

## Codex workflow
Always instruct Codex to read:
- docs/INVARIANTS.md
- docs/SPEC.md
- docs/API.md
- docs/STATE.md
- docs/BYBIT.md

Then allowlist the exact files it may modify and require:
- git diff
- changed files list
- commands to verify
- no guessing; questions go into docs/TASKS.md
